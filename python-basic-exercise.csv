1,Python: Print a string in a specified format,"Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).<p><em>Sample String:</em> ""Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are!""</p>The print statement (Python 2.6) has been replaced with a print() function (Python 2.6), with keyword arguments to replace most of the special syntax of the old print statement .Pictorial Presentation:","print(""Twinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are! \n\t\tUp above the world so high, \n\t\tLike a diamond in the sky. \nTwinkle, twinkle, little star, \n\tHow I wonder what you are!"")

2,Python: Get the Python version,"Write a Python program to get the Python version you are using.A string containing the version number of the Python interpreter plus additional information on the build number and compiler used. This string is displayed when the interactive interpreter is started. Version info: A tuple containing the five components of the version number: major, minor, micro, releaselevel, and serial. All values except releaselevel are integers; the release level is 'alpha', 'beta', 'candidate', or 'final'. The version_info value corresponding to the Python version 2.0 is (2, 0, 0, 'final', 0). The components can also be accessed by name, so sys.version_info[0] is equivalent to sys.version_info.major and so on.Note : 'sys' module provides access to some variables used or maintained by the interpreter and to functions that interact strongly with the interpreter.<p><strong>Sample Solution</strong>:- </p>Python Code:Sample Output:Flowchart:","import sys
print(""Python version"")
print (sys.version)
print(""Version info."")
print (sys.version_info)

3,Python: Display the current date and time ,"Write a Python program to display the current date and time.Python datetime: The datetime module supplies classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. datetime.now(tz=None) returns the current local date and time. If optional argument tz is None or not specified, this is like today().<p><img alt=""Python date time"" src=""https://www.w3resource.com/w3r_images/python-date-time-exercise-3.png"" style=""max-width:100%;display:block;height=auto""/></p> date.strftime(format) returns a string representing the date, controlled by an explicit format string. Format codes referring to hours, minutes or seconds will see 0 values. <p><strong>Sample Solution</strong>:- </p>Python Code:Sample Output: Flowchart:","import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
print (""Current date and time : "")
print (now.strftime(""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""))

4,Python: Input the radius of a circle and compute the area ,"Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area.Python: Area of a Circle In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius r is πr2. Here the Greek letter π represents a constant, approximately equal to 3.14159, which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.<p><strong>Sample Solution</strong>:- </p>Python Code:Sample Output: Flowchart:","from math import pi
r = float(input (""Input the radius of the circle : ""))
print (""The area of the circle with radius "" + str(r) + "" is: "" + str(pi * r**2))
"
5,Python: Print first and last name in reverse order with a space between them ,"Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.Python has two functions designed for accepting data directly from the user:raw_input(): raw_input() asks the user for a string of data and simply returns the string, the string data ended with a newline). It can also take an argument, which is displayed as a prompt before the user enters the data.prints outTo assign the user's name to a variable ""x"" you can use following command :input(): In 3.x .raw_input() is renamed to input(). input() function reads a line from sys.stdin and returns it with the trailing newline stripped.To assign the user's name to a variable ""y"" you can use following command :Pictorial Presentation:","fname = input(""Input your First Name : "")
lname = input(""Input your Last Name : "")
print (""Hello  "" + lname + "" "" + fname)
